- no. of interactions per sessions
- log data
- Nighttime or Off-Hour Cramming
- Erratic Login Patterns
- Hint Overuse Without Progress
- Task Switching / Avoidance
- Frequent Session Abandonment

step 2
- data base these metrics

step 3
- rule-based if statements
- functions measuring activity within site

step 4
- compile and comprehend the step 3 results

step 5
- use algorithm(bayes, logistics, etc) to create results
- results will create distribution curve
- within the curve will decide which procrastinator or not
